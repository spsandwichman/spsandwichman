### yo!

i'm seth, but i go by sandwichman online. i like low-level programming, computer/processor architecture, and compilers. I mainly use C, although I have experience in Odin and Python.

i'm the lead developer of [orbit systems](https://github.com/orbit-systems), a developer group focused on learning through doing. we work on the [aphelion cpu architecture](https://github.com/orbit-systems/aphelion) and projects that surround and support it, such as its [emulator](https://github.com/orbit-systems/comet), its [assembler](https://github.com/orbit-systems/comet), and the [mars programming language](https://github.com/orbit-systems/mars).

i also create digital art and graphic design as **technichron** over at [technichronart.com](https://www.technichronart.com/).
