### yo!

hey, i'm sandwichman. i like low-level programming, computer/processor architecture, and compilers. I mainly use C, although I have experience in Odin and Python.

i'm the lead developer of [Orbit Systems](https://github.com/orbit-systems), a developer group focused on learning through doing. we work on the [Aphelion CPU Architecture](https://github.com/orbit-systems/aphelion) and projects that surround and support it, such as [its emulator, Comet](https://github.com/orbit-systems/comet), [its official assembler, Luna](https://github.com/orbit-systems/comet), the [Mars programming language](https://github.com/orbit-systems/mars).
