### yo!

i'm seth, but i go by sandwichman online. i like low-level programming, computer/processor architecture, and compilers. i mainly use C, although i have experience in java, rust, odin, and python.

right now, i'm working on [coyote](https://github.com/spsandwichman/coyote), a next-generation [jackal](https://github.com/xrarch/newsdk/tree/main/Jackal) compiler. The repository is also home to [iron](https://github.com/spsandwichman/coyote/src/iron), a lightweight but powerful optimizing compiler backend. Both of these projects are being developed side-by-side, but iron can be built and used independently as a library.

i'm the lead developer of [orbit systems](https://github.com/orbit-systems), a developer group focused on learning through doing. we work on the [aphelion cpu architecture](https://github.com/orbit-systems/aphelion) and projects that surround and support it, such as its [emulator](https://github.com/orbit-systems/comet), its [assembler](https://github.com/orbit-systems/comet), and the [mars programming language](https://github.com/orbit-systems/mars).

none of my projects are (or will be) made with AI. i do not accept contributions that use AI tools. if you don't care enough to write your own code, i don't care enough to read it.
