### yo!

i'm seth, but i go by sandwichman online. i like low-level programming, computer/processor architecture, and compilers. i mainly use C, although i have experience in java, rust, odin, and python.

right now, i'm working on [mars and coyote](https://github.com/spsandwichman/mars), my own programming language and a next-generation [jackal](https://github.com/xrarch/newsdk/tree/main/Jackal) frontend. the repository is also home to [iron](https://github.com/spsandwichman/mars/tree/main/src/iron), a lightweight but powerful optimizing compiler backend. these projects are being developed side-by-side, but iron can be built and used independently as a library.

i'm the lead developer of [orbit systems](https://github.com/orbit-systems), a developer group focused on learning through doing. we work on the [aphelion cpu architecture](https://github.com/orbit-systems/aphelion) and projects that surround and support it.

none of my projects contain ai-generated content. i do not accept contributions that contain ai-generated content. 
if you don't care enough to write your own code, i don't care enough to read it.
